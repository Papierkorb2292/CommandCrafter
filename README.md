# CommandCrafter

The CommandCrafter Minecraft mod aims to provide useful tools for command development.

With this mod and the corresponding [CommandCrafter vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Papierkorb2292.commandcrafter), it is possible to connect vscode to the running Minecraft instance and get datapack language support for whatever Minecraft you're running. Besides syntax highlighting, error checking, definition providers and hover providers, this includes debugging functionality that allows you to set breakpoints and step through functions while keeping track of the current command context. Additionally, vscode can show you the log output of the server you're on and lets you directly execute commands from the vscode window. Furthermore, this project lets you view scoreboards and storages in VSCode as well as reload datapacks or resourcepacks using the corresponding VSCode commands (which can also be bound to keyboard shortcuts).

Additionally, the mod includes a flexible extension of the vanilla datapack parser, which makes new function syntax possible. This mod provides an improved version of the vanilla function language, currently offering multiline commands without backslashes and inline functions/tags. This new function syntax can be transpiled to a vanilla datapack by the mod using the `/datapack build` command.
