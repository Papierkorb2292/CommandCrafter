# CommandCrafter

This extension is meant to be used together with the "CommandCrafter" Minecraft mod. It adds a mcfunction
language and allows you to connect to the language server and debugger provided by the mod. A connection
to the language server is necessary for syntax highlighting and other language features for Minecraft datapacks
and also allows you to view the Minecraft log output by opening the "Minecraft Console" view in vscode.
